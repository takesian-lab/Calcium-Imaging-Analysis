##### This is a work in progress


The stim_protocol code is:
- noiseburst      = 1
- ReceptiveField  = 2
- FM sweep        = 3
- widefield       = 4
- SAM             = 5
- SAM freq        = 6
- behavior        = 7
- behavior        = 8
- random h20      = 9
- noiseburst_ITI  = 10
- random air      = 11
- spontaneous     = 12
- behavior MT     = 13

# Running the code
## Command line

1. Compile blocks
- Make Info excel spreadsheet outside of MATLAB. Look at the example spreadsheet and "Data Structure for Info" PDF within this folder for help.
- Update paths at the top of compile_blocks_from_info
- Run compile_blocks_from_info
- Visualize the output of a single block with the function visualize_block
- Visualize the output of a single cell from a block with the function visualize_cell

2. Analyze
- You can use either the same Info spreadsheet as before or create a dedicated spreadsheet for each type of analysis you want to do.
- Update paths at the top of anlaysis_2P_v3
- Run analysis_2P_v3
